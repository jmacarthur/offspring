# Millihertz Model F ("Offspring")

This is a project to create a working replica of the Manchester small-scale experimental machine, otherwise known as the Manchester Baby.

It will be implemented fully mechanically, that is, without any electronic or electric components. All power must be taken from a single rotating shaft input.

The finished machine should be a complete, binary-compatible implementation of the original SSEM, capable of running the same programs.

It will be significantly slower than the original machine. It is meant to operate at about one cycle every 10 seconds (100mHz) compared to the 1kHz+ operation of the original machine.

The goal of this machine is to act as a visual demonstration of the operation of a stored-program computer, and to demonstrate that computation is a concept independent of current technologies such as photo-etched silicon.
