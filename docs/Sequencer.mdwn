# Sequencer details

Starting position: Instruction register should be clear, nothing asserted on the address bus. Memory bank should be deactivated.

## Instruction fetch

* Pulse PC reader to read program counter
* Switch destination registers to instruction register.
* Assert program counter onto address bus
* Activate memory bank
  -- Delay for memory to read into regenerator --
* Regenerate memory
  -- Delay for memory to regen and instruction register to read in --

## Decode

* Deactivate memory
* Instruction regsiter diversion off
* (Instruction logic) set up program counter / accumulator
* Assert instruction register onto address bus
* Activate memory cell

  --  Delay while waiting for memory to read in

* Meanwhile, if LDN, dump the accumulator.
* If STO, Fire the accumulator reader.
* If JMP, dump the program counter.

* Regen memory if we aren't in STO mode.

Following this, data fells either into the accumulator or instruction reg.

 -- Delay while the subtractor works

* For STO, activate the accumulator sender.

 -- Delay to read into memory

* Deactivate memory cell.

* Clear instruction register.

Repeat cycle.

## Outputs from the sequencer

### Signals not dependent on instruction

* PC reader
* Redirector 1 (to instruction register)
* Memory cell activate [1]
* Instruction register clear
* Assert instruction reg section to address bus
* Regenerate memory (STO does not need it, but there will be nothing in it, so asserting it does nothing)
* Accumulator sender (only does anything if we hit 'read accumulator')
* Assert PC to address bus

[1] It's an optimisation to not read memory on the second cycle if we have a CMP/STOP

### Signals dependent on instructions

* Read accumulator (Only for STO)
* Redirector 2 (to program counter) - only if JMP/JRP
* Clear program counter - only for JMP
* Clear accumulator - only for LDN
* Memory output dump - only for STO
* Add one to PC (CMP and accumulator top bit set)

# Instructions (written LSB on the right, unlike the original type)

000 JMP
001 JRP
010 LDN
011 STO
100 SUB
101 Also SUB
110 CMP
111 STOP

We don't implement STOP as JMP can put the processor in a halt loop.

Optimisation: For CMP and STOP, we don't need to read memory, so don't bother - it means we have to recirculate more ball bearings.

Most of these are single-instruction things - only 'data divert to PC' is unusual as it happens for two instructions. We can just have two separate lines which push it, if necessary. 'Regen after data read' is best negated - we can drop a vital link for the STO case rather than raising one.

For the CMP case - we need only feed one ball beaing into the read column for the 31st bit of the accumulator. If it was set to one, we capture the ball bearing coming out of the 1 column and divert this to the instruction counter. Note that we don't want to do this while reading the accumulator normally!
