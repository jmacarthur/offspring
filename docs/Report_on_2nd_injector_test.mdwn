The parts we cut weren't sufficient to re-assemble - we need to cut most of the remaining parts since the supports have moved further apart with the new spacing. The levers themselves can stay.

The holes to screw the tube holders together would be better at the bottom of the bracket - as they are at the top at the moment, the brackets tend to lever closer at the top and leave the bottom loose.
