3mm holes for screws are very slightly too small; screws fit but it's a hassle.

Hex bars are slightly stiff and occasionally the balls don't have enough force to turn them. Might be better with thinner hex bar, but it broadly works (and might need breaking in)

We need lots of:
* 30mm x 3mm machine screws
* Spacers: 7mm, 4mm and 2mm M3 spacers
* M3 nuts


Spacers: 4mm, 7mm http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M3-M4-M5-M6-M8-Nylon-plastic-spacers-standoff-washers/282477022050?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D46150%26meid%3Dc6ae66c8c6934bdeb4b49221fea361fe%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D291682387238&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851

2mm spacers: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Black-Nylon-Spacers-M3-M4-M5-M6-M8-AND-M10-in-Various-Lengths-Pack-10-Spacer-/291682387238?var=&hash=item43e9a00526:m:mXqb1HVUZ2aOTvHzNXMVCCg

Washers may be better for 2mm work. Thick M3 washers (http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Metric-A2-Stainless-Steel-Extra-Thick-Flat-Spacer-Washers-M3-to-M20-/371113451734?var=&hash=item566815e0d6:m:mkeniR3DfXObOHR6agQ9klA) are 1mm thick and can be bought in bulk. (However, they are larger diameter, and may get in the way)
