Report on the first injector test (commit a38ac62b9e9f42b00ca45dd6d0c3af85378d828e).

Use test-injector-v1.dxf. This did not load immediately into the laser cutter software at MadFabLab, but loading it into LibreCAD and saving again seemed to fix that.

Design fits together well on a 0.1mm kerf and the tolerance on the comb is good.

We need some way to adjust the spacing between the front bars. We can either add spacers in there which hold things a fixed distance apart, or add screws which can adjust it manually. The 3mm spacing between the input bars is not quite enough; ball bearings tend to get pushed out of place from here with the simple force of a slope.

A slope of 20mm raise over 200mm seems sufficient to keep the ball bearings moving. We might be able to reduce that by polishing the input rails.

The holders for the 1mm plastic tube need to be adjusted; the gaps are too wide to grip the tube unless the output rails are very close togehter, and then ball bearings will not fall into them.

Ball bearings are 6.28mm, not 6mm, and we need to adjust the pitch of all components for this. We can re-use the ejectors and frame.

Ejecting ball bearings from the input rail works well as long as the levers are roughly aligned with the ball bearings.

Assembly of the device is very difficult. It would be easier if we could glue components together.
